Application servers act as an intermediary between users and backend systems, managing the business logic, data access, and various application operations. They handle requests from clients, process them, and then generate dynamic content or perform specific tasks before sending responses back to the clients. These servers provide an environment to run applications and host services, ensuring seamless communication between users and backend systems.

Key functionalities and characteristics of application servers include:

1. **Request Handling**: They receive incoming requests from clients (such as web browsers or other applications) and manage the flow of these requests through the application's components.

2. **Business Logic**: Application servers execute the core logic of an application. They process data, perform calculations, and manipulate information based on the specific requirements of the application.

3. **Database Access**: They facilitate interaction with databases or other data sources. Application servers retrieve and update data from databases, providing a layer of abstraction between the application and the underlying data storage.

4. **Middleware Services**: They often offer middleware services such as transaction management, security, messaging, and integration with other systems or services.

5. **Scalability and Load Balancing**: Application servers are designed to handle multiple concurrent connections and often provide mechanisms for scaling applications horizontally (across multiple servers) or vertically (by adding resources to a single server). Load balancing across multiple instances can be managed to ensure optimal performance.

6. **Support for Multiple Protocols and Technologies**: They can support various protocols and technologies, enabling the integration of diverse systems and services within an application environment.

7. **Session Management**: For web applications, they manage user sessions, maintaining state between multiple requests from the same user.

Common examples of application servers include Apache Tomcat, JBoss, WildFly, IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic, and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). These servers are used across a wide range of applications, from web-based applications and e-commerce platforms to enterprise-level systems.

Each application server might have its own set of features, strengths, and optimal use cases, but generally, they all serve the fundamental purpose of hosting and managing applications, ensuring efficient communication between clients and the backend systems.
