"Localhost" is a hostname used in computer networking to refer to the current computer that is being used to access it. It is primarily used to access network services running on the same computer via the loopback network interface. The loopback interface allows running network services without the need for a physical network connection and makes them inaccessible from external networks.

When a user accesses "localhost," it resolves to the IP addresses 127.0.0.1 (IPv4 loopback address) and ::1 (IPv6 loopback address). These addresses are reserved for loopback purposes, meaning any data sent to them is redirected back to the computer without leaving the network interface.

The name resolution of "localhost" is usually configured in the computer's hosts file, mapping it to the loopback addresses. The Domain Name System (DNS) servers may also resolve "localhost," but the resolution should happen locally and not be forwarded to remote servers.

The name "localhost" is reserved for loopback purposes according to IETF standards, ensuring that any query for it will resolve to the respective loopback address. It cannot be used as a domain name in the DNS system.

Packets addressed to a loopback address are processed in the link layer of the TCP/IP stack, never reaching any physical network interface. This allows for testing software and running local services even without actual hardware network connections.

The use of "localhost" in certain applications may differ from using the loopback addresses directly. For example, in MySQL, connecting to "localhost" might use a Unix domain socket, while connecting to 127.0.0.1 or ::1 requires using the explicit IP addresses.

Overall, "localhost" is a crucial concept for testing and running network services locally on a computer without relying on external network connections.
