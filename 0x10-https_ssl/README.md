 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP protocol used for transmitting data between a user's web browser and a website. It is secured using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). Here's an overview of HTTPS and SSL:

HTTP vs. HTTPS:

HTTP: The standard HTTP protocol transmits data between your web browser and a website in plain text. This means that data exchanged between your browser and the web server can potentially be intercepted and read by malicious actors during transmission.
HTTPS: HTTPS, on the other hand, adds a layer of security by encrypting the data transmitted between your browser and the web server. This encryption ensures that even if someone intercepts the data, they can't read it without the encryption key.
SSL/TLS:

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over the internet. They provide encryption and authentication mechanisms.
SSL was the earlier protocol, and TLS is its more modern and secure version. However, people often use "SSL" to refer to both protocols.
How HTTPS Works:

When you access a website using HTTPS, your browser and the web server perform a "handshake." During this handshake, they agree on encryption methods and exchange keys.
Once the handshake is complete, all data exchanged between your browser and the web server is encrypted, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized parties to intercept or tamper with the data.
SSL/TLS Certificates:

To enable HTTPS on a website, the website owner must obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). This certificate contains the website's public key and information about the website.
