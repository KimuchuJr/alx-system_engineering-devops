Parsing:
Parsing involves extracting specific information or data from a larger dataset, such as a string or a file. It is commonly used for data processing and manipulation. Libraries and functions in various programming languages provide parsing capabilities. For example, in Python, you can use the split() method to parse strings, and in JavaScript, you can use regular expressions for parsing.

Here's an example of parsing a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file in Python:

python
Copy code
data = "John,Doe,25"
parsed_data = data.split(",")
print("First Name:", parsed_data[0])
print("Last Name:", parsed_data[1])
print("Age:", parsed_data[2])
Parsing is a broad topic and can involve handling structured data like JSON, XML, or more complex text data.
